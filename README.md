Here I present my solutions on collection of Python excersizes that I found the most fun and interesting to work on.

Let me explain how the code from each particular excersize works.

SPIRAL MATRIX

In the 'spiral-matrix' excersize I wrote a code that  takes as an input a number, n,  and builds a matrix of a size of nxn, filled with numbers from 1 to n^2 in a spiral-like manner, i.e., the spiral starts at the top left corner of the matrix and then turns clockwise every time it reaches a new corner.

Here is an example of how this code works:

Sample Input:
5
Sample Output:
1  2  3  4  5
16 17 18 19 6
15 24 25 20 7
14 23 22 21 8
13 12 11 10 9

For more examples, checkout the jupyter notebook file in the 'spiral-matrix' folder.
