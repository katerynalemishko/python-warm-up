Here I present my solutions on collection of Python excersizes that I found the most fun and interesting to work on.

Let me explain how the code from each particular excersize works.


SPIRAL MATRIX

In the 'spiral-matrix' excercise I wrote a code that  takes as an input a number, n,  and builds a matrix of a size of nxn, filled with numbers from 1 to n^2 in a spiral-like manner, i.e., the spiral starts at the top left corner of the matrix and then turns clockwise every time it reaches a new corner.

Here is an example of how this code works:

Sample Input:
5
Sample Output:
1  2  3  4  5
16 17 18 19 6
15 24 25 20 7
14 23 22 21 8
13 12 11 10 9

For more examples, check the Jupyter notebook file in the 'spiral-matrix' folder.


DICE ROLLING

In the dice-rolling exercise I simulate a game that involves throwing dice. 
A player starts the game at the bottom the stairs and moves up or down the stairs according to the roll of a single die:

-if the die roll is 3,4 or 5, the player makes one step up the stairs;
-if the die roll is 1 or 2, the player needs to make one step down (if he is currently at the step 0, he does not make any move);
-if the die roll is 6, the player needs to roll the die again and make as many steps forward as the new roll of the die shows.

In the code I wrote I simulate this game to answers the question about the most probable outcome of the game after making a certain number of steps.
The results provided by the code can be used to increase the probability of oneâ€™s success in betting.
